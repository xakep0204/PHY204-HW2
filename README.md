# PHY204-HW2

Code used for the relaxation method exercise. The relaxation method algorithm is implemented in the `solver.cpp` file. The `grapher.py` file is used to generate the plots and timing benchmark for the exercise.

## Usage

```python3 grapher.py <L= number of points>```

Please uncomment the plt.show() line in the `grapher.py` file to see the plots.
